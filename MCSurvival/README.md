# MCSurvival (LMS) (Battle Royal)
A heavily in-progress plugin that will eventually be a Last Man Standing gamemode. The premise is that players will spawn on an island with very limited materials and limited starting items. The gamemode will last anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 week. The world borders will close in at a rate dependant on the gamemode. Any player who logs out of the server before they die or the game ends, will not be safe. A fake body will drop with all of their items. The body will continuously teleport further inwards while offline making it easier and easier to find as the game goes on.
