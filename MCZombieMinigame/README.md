# ZombieMinigame
This minigame will, in theory, be almost like a Tower Defense Game. The game will have kits that players can select that will have special attributes and skills they can use to stop an infinite wave of zombies going into the town. The further player goes, the more zombies spawn with increasing difficulty/health/damage.
## Ingame playing
When a player kills a zombie, the entire team will recieve gold. Gold can be used to buy items that will help you deal more damage, increase speed, attack speed, health, recovery, and more. Gold can also be used to upgrade your kit. Upgraded kits will have special attributes that will be displayed on the KitSelection screen

## Kits (! - Added $ - In the working)
* !Slayer - An all around average kit. (Default and first you have unlocked). Will come with a basic sword but can be upgraded down two different paths. Either dual-wielder or acrobatist. The Dual-Wielder route will focus around damage speed and blunt force hits. Acrobatist will focus on skills the player will acquire (Like ground-pounding, spinning in a circle, etc..)
* $Medic
* $Engineer
* $Juggernaugt
