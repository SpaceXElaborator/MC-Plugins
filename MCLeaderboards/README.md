# Leaderboards #
** Will be moving into MCEssentials once done **
## Summary Idea ##
This 'plugin' will act as an API for creating, viewing, setting, and displaying leaderboards (Yes viewing and displaying will be different). Being able to tie any plugin that would require some kind of leaderboard, registering the leaderboard option, and then making sure to give it value. This plugin will also be tied with MySQL to make sure that values are stored cross-server AND can be put onto a website to view from there.
