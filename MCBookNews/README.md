# MCBookNews #
Still a work in progress. CreateBooks.java is being redone and moved to BookManager.java

### Summary ###
BookNews is a standalone application that only requires the MCEssentials to work.
The premise of the plugin is to create a configuration that will load a random book into the 
players inventory to view special news in a fun way.

### Issues ###
CreateBooks.java
* Poorly written

BookManager.java
* Has some issues when loading commands or loading suggested commands

### Plans ###
* Redo BookManager.java
* Move to JSON loading
* No longer use REGEX to load strings
